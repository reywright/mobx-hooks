Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Goal is to build some solid structure for future sites.

Current tech:

- react (hooks, context)
- mobx
- mobx-state-tree
- mobx-lite
- prettier + husky
- typescript
- jest (unit tests)

Future tech introductions:

- axios
- tailwind (or styled components)
  Note: this is a type of framework that people either love or hate.
  I myself love it, for more commonly used atomic CSS bits. Used in
  combination with styled components or css modules for more specific
  styles, can be a real game changer.
- react-testing-libray (integration)
- cypress (e2e)
- react-wired

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start` to run the server

### `yarn test` to execute tests
